# Surakshit_Rails-Prototype-Research-And-Resource
This project was developed for Smart India Hackathon (SIH) to detect cracks on railway tracks using Acoustic Waves. It aims to provide an automated system for railway authorities to identify structural issues early, reducing accident risks and ensuring efficient maintenance operation

Features:
Real-time Detection: Capable of processing live video feeds or images captured by drones or track-side cameras.
Accuracy: Employs machine learning models for enhanced accuracy in detecting cracks of varying sizes and types.
Visualization: Provides a visual representation of detected cracks, including their location and severity.
